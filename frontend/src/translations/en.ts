Each session is filled with both familiar asanas that flow with the energy I know and new movements that challenge me to rethink my body's abilities. I've seen significant improvements in my flexibility, quality of life, sleep, and my connection with myself and nature. If you want to be happy, healthy, and calm, you should attend Irina's lessons.",

Even in the first session, I realized how asymmetrically developed my body was, and I became aware of which muscle groups needed work. Yoga with Irina also helps clear my mind of thoughts and focus on myself, my feelings, and sensations in the moment. After a few sessions, my physical condition improved noticeably. Now I try not to miss a class and highly recommend it to everyone.",

One day, I had the opportunity to attend one of her classes, and it was a game-changer! The session had various interesting poses that helped me stretch muscles I didn't even know I had. Despite being in a group class, Irina paid attention to each participant, ensuring that we did the poses correctly and safely. I felt a tremendous sense of lightness and emotional uplift after the session, something I can't achieve on my own at home. I highly recommend at least trying yoga with Irina; you won't stop at just one class! üòâ",

It was very cozy with you; you exude openness and kindness, which is incredibly important for a yoga instructor. Unfortunately, I didn't attend many sessions, but if it weren't for the distance, I would have continued for sure. I love that some exercises change every time, and I can see that you pay attention to everyone ‚Äî it's really sweet üòä. You also have an incredibly calming voice, which is also very important in this field. Thank you for the experience üôè.",
